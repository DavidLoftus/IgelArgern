# IgelArgern
Igel Ã„rgern game written in C

## Dependencies
CMake is used to create build files, make sure you have installed it using the instructions on their website https://cmake.org/download/

This application also uses the curses library, if you using Linux you can install it via the command:
```
sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev
```
On Windows, please use the MinGW compiler, you can install them and the ncurses library on the mingw-get installer. There is a few issues with this version of the library so Linux is the preferred platform.
Note: ncurses is not available on the MSVC toolchain and we have not added support for PDCurses.
